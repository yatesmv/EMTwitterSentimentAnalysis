Created this project during AIT526: Intro to Natural Language Processing with classmates Jaeho Shin and Mostafa Omidi

These scripts were ccreated using JupyterLab/JupyterNotebook in python.
There are 4 scripts involved:
        1. Exploratory Analysis
        2. Baseline Sentiment Analysis
        3. Updated Sentiment Analysis
        4. Sentiment Analysis Comparison

This script utilizes VADER, which was created by C.J. hutto and E.E. Gilbert (ref. 2), to determine the sentiment behind reactions of Elon Msuk's recent takeover of Twitter.
